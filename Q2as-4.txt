Imports:

The script imports requests for HTTP requests, time for delays, and PrettyTable for displaying results in a table.

Subdomains:

The subdomains list contains the URLs of the subdomains you want to check.

Check Status Function:

The check_status function attempts to get a response from the subdomain. It returns True for a 200 status code and False for any errors.

Main Loop:

The main function runs an infinite loop that creates a PrettyTable object to display the subdomain status.
It adds each subdomain and its status to the table and prints it out.
After displaying the status, it waits for 60 seconds before checking again.
